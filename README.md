# Build a Chatbot for your own Documents

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explains step by step how one can use existing technology to build a chatbot for one's own documents. The template is based on the [Langchain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) framework and uses OpenAI's embedding and GPT-3.5 models by default. 
Therefore one must create an OpenAI account and have enough credit to run the notebook. The cost depends on the amount of documents that are used for the chatbot and the number of questions asked. For more information about OpenAI's pricing model check out their [website](https://openai.com/pricing).
